This project creates a music recommendation system that provides users with different ways to discover songs:

Random Recommendation:
      Uses a random number generator to select a song from the available options, introducing an element of surprise.

Highest-Rated Recommendation:
      Implements a chosen rating mechanism (e.g., average user ratings, editorial scores) to identify and suggest the song with the highest rating.

Search-Based Recommendation:
      Allows users to enter keywords or search terms to find songs that match their criteria. String matching or fuzzy matching techniques which are employed to provide flexibility in searches.
