This project creates a music recommendation system that provides users with different ways to discover songs:

Random Recommendation (method 1):

Uses a random number generator to select a song from the available options, introducing an element of surprise.
Highest-Rated Recommendation (method 2):

Implements a chosen rating mechanism (e.g., average user ratings, editorial scores) to identify and suggest the song with the highest rating.
Search-Based Recommendation (method 3):

Allows users to enter keywords or search terms to find songs that match their criteria. String matching or fuzzy matching techniques can be employed to provide flexibility in searches.
